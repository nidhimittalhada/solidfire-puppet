This is an initial attempt to create a puppet provider for SolidFire. At 
present the code will run on any posix style machine and just use the SolidFire
API to call over to the SolidFire cluster and do as instructed.

In the future we will convert this over to the puppet network_device scenario
at which the information for the SolidFire cluster can come from the device.conf
file instead of being in the manifest as it is now.  

At the present, I have written providers: 
   solidfire_volume
   solidfire_account

For the moment the details are either in the code, or take a look at the 
examples directory and the comments in each example manifest.
